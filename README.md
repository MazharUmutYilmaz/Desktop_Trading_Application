Desktop Trading Application has been developed for trading.   

Desktop Trading Application includes:  

* "Rules" tab which contains crucial decisions before trading such as determining the trading type (e.g. Intraday, Swing), entry point for the position, close point for the position with profit/loss, trailing stop loss percentage with respect to Volatility Indicators such as ATR (Average True Range)
> 
* "Analysis Sheet" tab which contains specific selected indicators and their expositions such as "Is there a BUY/SELL signal on the MACD?" or "Is there a incompatibility between indicator and the price?"
> 
* "ATR-SL-TP-PL" tab which gives an opportunity to define Average True Range, Stop Loss, Take Profit and Profit Loss metrics for sustainable and successful trading.
> 
* "Trading Log" tab which supplies to record the trade by "Stock_Name", "# of Lot", "Price", "Position_Type", "Date"
> 
* "ML/DS" tab which converts the csv file that contains all datas coming from the tabs above to a new csv file together to supply Machine Learning/Data Science applications using the datas.  

Used modules+frameworks : Tkinter, datetime, os, csv
